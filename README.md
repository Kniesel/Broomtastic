# Broomtastic v 1.0

_DynWeb Quidditch-Webshop-Project_

This web application is an online Quidditch-Webshop. You can easily buy and order special Broomtastic Quidditch related products (e.g. broomsticks, Golden Snitches, bludgers, quaffles, quidditch clothes etc.) via owl or standard muggle postal service. The only thing you have to do is to create an account on our website and order your choice of product. Paying is possible via Euros, Pounds, as well as Galleons, Sickles and Knuts.
The aim of our web-app is very simple: We provide an online webshop for Quidditch equipment, since it is less suspicious for wizards and witches to order their things like muggles do it nowadays. Nevertheless, you can also buy our products if you are a muggle nerd or no-maj (like US citizen would rather say). But be prepared that some of them would probably not work for you like they would if you were magically gifted.
